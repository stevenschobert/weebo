Weebo
=====

> **tl;dr** &mdash; use [elixir-xml_rpc](https://github.com/ewildgoose/elixir-xml_rpc) instead

I wrote Weebo in early 2015 because there were no libraries at the time to do XML-RPC style parsing. It was my first Elixir package, and I learned a ton from it.

After I open-sourced Weebo, [@ewildgoose](https://github.com/ewildgoose) released their own [XML-RPC parser](https://github.com/ewildgoose/elixir-xml_rpc) for Elixir, and I felt it was better than Weebo in several areas, so I decided to deprecate weebo in favor of it.

The code will still remain available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevenschobert/weebo) for reference/leanring, but I'll no longer be supporting it.

**Check out [elixir-xml_rpc](https://github.com/ewildgoose/elixir-xml_rpc) on GitHub.**
